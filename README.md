*is a given compact binary merger candidate event predicted to have enough remnant matter to power an electromagnetic counterpart or not?*

### Notebooks

*these notebooks offer a demonstration of the analysis and showcase the key results*

nsbh-remnant.ipynb *# plot remnant matter contours from Foucart+ 2018 fit to NSBH merger simulations and compare against estimated event parameters*

bns-remnant.ipynb *# plot remnant matter contours from Kruger+Foucart 2020 fit to BNS merger simulations and compare against estimated event parameters*

### Data

*the src/ directory contains the utilities needed for the analysis*

fhn18.py # Foucart+ 2018 fit for remnant matter in NSBH merger simulations \
kf20.py # Kruger+Foucart 2020 fit for remnant matter in NSBH merger simulations \
plot.py # main plotting utility \
utils.py # define physical constants and other useful quantities
