*is a given compact binary merger candidate event predicted to have enough remnant matter to power an electromagnetic counterpart or not?*

### Notebooks

*these notebooks offer a demonstration of the analysis and showcase the key results*

nsbh-remnant.ipynb *# plot remnant matter contours from Foucart+ 2018 fit to NSBH merger simulations and compare against estimated event parameters*

### Data

*the etc/ directory contains the data and utilities needed for the analysis*

### Scripts

*these scripts are used for production analyses*
